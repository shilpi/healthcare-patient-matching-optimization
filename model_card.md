# Model Card: Bayesian Optimization for Patient Matching

## Model Details

### Basic Information

- **Model Name**: Patient Matching Bayesian Optimizer
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Type**: Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Process Regression
- **Date**: May 16, 2025
- **License**: MIT License

### Overview

This model uses Bayesian Optimization to find optimal parameters for patient matching algorithms in healthcare interoperability systems. It optimizes field weights, similarity thresholds, and matching strategies to maximize the accuracy of patient record linkage across disparate healthcare systems.

## Intended Use

### Primary Intended Uses

The primary intended use is to optimize patient matching algorithms for Enterprise Master Patient Index (eMPI) solutions in healthcare organizations. The model helps determine the optimal configuration of matching parameters to maximize accuracy when linking patient records across different healthcare systems.

### Primary Intended Users

- Healthcare IT administrators
- Health information exchange (HIE) operators
- Electronic health record (EHR) system developers
- Healthcare interoperability researchers
- Data quality managers in healthcare organizations

### Out-of-Scope Use Cases

This model should not be used for:
- Direct clinical decision-making
- Replacing human review for critical patient matching decisions
- Optimizing matching algorithms for non-healthcare domains without adaptation
- Production deployment without thorough validation on organization-specific data

## Factors

### Relevant Factors

The model's performance may be influenced by:
- Demographic characteristics of the patient population
- Data quality and completeness in source systems
- Types and frequency of data entry errors
- Regional naming conventions and address formats
- Healthcare organization size and patient volume

### Evaluation Factors

The model was evaluated on synthetic patient data with artificially introduced errors to simulate real-world data quality issues. Evaluation metrics include precision, recall, and F1 score for patient matching accuracy.

## Metrics

### Model Performance Measures

The model is evaluated using:
- **Precision**: Proportion of predicted matches that are true matches
- **Recall**: Proportion of true matches that are correctly predicted
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Optimization Efficiency**: Number of iterations required to reach optimal performance

### Decision Thresholds

The model optimizes the similarity threshold for determining matches, balancing the trade-off between false positives (incorrectly merged records) and false negatives (missed matches).

### Approaches to Uncertainty and Variability

The Bayesian Optimization approach inherently quantifies uncertainty through the Gaussian Process model, allowing for exploration-exploitation trade-offs during parameter optimization.

## Evaluation Data

### Datasets

The model was evaluated using synthetic patient data from the Synthea dataset, with artificially introduced errors to simulate real-world data quality issues. The dataset was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

### Motivation

Synthetic data was chosen to avoid privacy concerns while still providing realistic patient demographics and error patterns. The introduced errors simulate common data quality issues in healthcare systems, such as typos, missing information, and name variations.

### Preprocessing

Preprocessing steps included:
1. Selecting relevant demographic fields for matching
2. Creating duplicate records with various types of errors
3. Generating ground truth match pairs for evaluation
4. Splitting data into training and testing sets

## Training Data

The model uses an iterative optimization approach rather than traditional supervised learning. It learns from evaluations of different parameter configurations on the training dataset, using a Gaussian Process to model the relationship between parameters and matching performance.

## Quantitative Analyses

### Unitary Results

In our experiments, the optimized patient matching algorithm achieved:
- Precision: 0.92
- Recall: 0.88
- F1 Score: 0.90

This represents a significant improvement over baseline configurations with uniform field weights and standard thresholds.

### Intersectional Results

The model's performance was consistent across different demographic groups in the synthetic dataset. However, performance may vary in real-world applications depending on the demographic composition and data quality of specific healthcare organizations.

## Ethical Considerations

### Data

The use of synthetic data mitigates privacy concerns, but users should be aware that the synthetic data may not perfectly represent all demographic groups or error patterns found in real healthcare systems.

### Human Life

Patient matching accuracy directly impacts patient safety and care quality. False negatives (missed matches) can lead to incomplete medical histories, while false positives (incorrect matches) can lead to mixing records from different patients. Both errors can potentially result in inappropriate clinical decisions.

### Mitigations

To mitigate risks:
- The model optimizes for F1 score, balancing precision and recall
- High-confidence thresholds are recommended for production use
- Human review is advised for borderline matching cases
- Regular retraining with organization-specific data is recommended

### Risks and Harms

Potential risks include:
- Algorithmic bias if certain demographic groups have systematically different data quality
- Over-reliance on automated matching without human oversight
- Inappropriate parameter settings if deployed without validation on local data

### Use Cases

The model should be used as a tool to assist in configuring patient matching systems, not as a replacement for human judgment in critical matching decisions.

## Caveats and Recommendations

- The model was trained and evaluated on synthetic data, which may not capture all nuances of real patient data
- Performance should be validated on organization-specific data before production deployment
- Regular monitoring and retraining are recommended as data patterns evolve
- The optimized parameters should be considered a starting point, with potential need for adjustment based on specific organizational requirements
- Transparency in matching decisions should be maintained to allow for human review of critical cases
- Complementary approaches such as patient portals for self-identification should be considered alongside algorithmic matching
